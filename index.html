<h1>CO₂ Emissions over the Globe</h1>
<h4>Written by Adrian Matteo Paolucci</h4>
<p>The change in environment over time across the globe has been well documented up until this point. It is widely known that statistics such as CO₂ emissions, forestation and global warming are some parameters which have made the world believe the environment is in trouble. Is this really the case? This page delves into the impact of forestation, trade activity and agriculture on CO₂ emissions and temperature change. We will also look into impact by country and continent and see if the same trends apply to respective continents.</p>
