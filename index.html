<h1>CO₂ Emissions over the Globe</h1>
<h4>Written by Adrian Matteo Paolucci</h4>
<p>The change in environment over time across the globe has been well documented up until this point. It is widely known that statistics such as CO₂ emissions, forestation and global warming are some parameters which have made the world believe the environment is in trouble. Is this really the case? This page delves into the impact of forestation, trade activity and agriculture on CO₂ emissions and temperature change. We will also look into impact by country and continent and see if the same trends apply to respective continents.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Forestation and CO₂ Emissions</h2>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="left">
   <h3 class="forestation">Forestation</h3>
    Forestation is represented by the amount of <strong>forest land as a percentage of total land</strong>. This statistic may show <strong>correlation to CO₂ emissions</strong> as environmentally friendly countries are typically more 'green'.
  <br>
    <br>
    Although percentage forestation is not the only factor influencing CO₂ emissions, the way that <strong>CO₂ is absorbed by greenery</strong> theoretically should reduce CO₂ emissions in the given country.

  }).catch(console.error);
</script>  
    
      

  </div>
  <div class="right">
  <h3 class="right-text">Geographical Relationship</h3>
    From the map, we can see some continents such as <strong>South America</strong> and parts of <strong>Africa</strong> have more forestation compared to less 'green' areas.
<br>
    <br>
    The forestation number has a <strong>twofold infuence</strong> on a Country's environmental impact. Firstly, more greenery means the plantation can <strong>absorb more Carbon Dioxide</strong> from the atmosphere. Secondly, a country may <strong>care more about environmental issues</strong> by maintaining their forestation as a high percentage of their land.

<h2>CO₂ Emissions and GDP</h2>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="left">
    <h3 class="forestation">GDP Per Capita</h3>
    GDP is measured as 'GDP per capita', which means the Gross Domestic Product of a country is divided by the number of people residing in the country. GDP per capita is used in this context to provide an indication of a given country's 'trade activity'.
    <h3 class="Emissions">CO₂ Emissions</h3>
    CO₂ emissions measured in kilotonnes. CO₂ emissions are the most commonly used mean to measure the influence countries have on the environment alongside temperature increases.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The filters are provided to see where Continents and different sized populations rank against eachother when comparing CO₂ emissions produced.

  <h3 class="right-text">How do these relate?</h3>
   From the map, we can see some continents such as South America and parts of Africa have more forestation. However, other parts of Africa and portions of Europe are not very 'green'. The trends between continents and CO₂ emissions are shown in the next section.
