<h1>CO₂ Emissions over the Globe</h1>
<h4>Written by Adrian Matteo Paolucci</h4>
<p>The change in environment over time across the globe has been well documented up until this point. It is widely known that statistics such as CO₂ emissions, forestation and global warming are some parameters which have made the world believe the environment is in trouble. Is this really the case? This page delves into the impact of forestation, trade activity and agriculture on CO₂ emissions and temperature change. We will also look into impact by country and continent and see if the same trends apply to respective continents.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Forestation and CO₂ Emissions</h2>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="left">
   <h3 class="forestation">Forestation</h3>
    Forestation is represented by the amount of <strong>forest land as a percentage of total land</strong>. This statistic may show <strong>correlation to CO₂ emissions</strong> as environmentally friendly countries are typically more 'green'.
  <br>
    <br>
    Although percentage forestation is not the only factor influencing CO₂ emissions, the way that <strong>CO₂ is absorbed by greenery</strong> theoretically should reduce CO₂ emissions in the given country.

  var spec2 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianpaolucci/assignment2/main/js/choropleth_map.vg.json";
  vegaEmbed('#choropleth_map', spec2).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script>  
    
      

  </div>
  <div class="right">
  <h3 class="right-text">Geographical Relationship</h3>
    From the map, we can see some continents such as <strong>South America</strong> and parts of <strong>Africa</strong> have more forestation compared to less 'green' areas.
<br>
    <br>
    The forestation number has a <strong>twofold infuence</strong> on a Country's environmental impact. Firstly, more greenery means the plantation can <strong>absorb more Carbon Dioxide</strong> from the atmosphere. Secondly, a country may <strong>care more about environmental issues</strong> by maintaining their forestation as a high percentage of their land.

<h2>CO₂ Emissions and GDP</h2>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="left">
    <h3 class="forestation">GDP Per Capita</h3>
    GDP is measured as <strong>'GDP per capita'</strong>, which means the Gross Domestic Product of a country is divided by the number of people residing in the country. GDP per capita is used in this context to provide an indication of a given country's <strong>'trade activity'</strong>.
    <br>
    <h3 class="Emissions">CO₂ Emissions</h3>
    CO₂ emissions <strong>measured in kilotonnes</strong>. CO₂ emissions are the most commonly used mean to measure the <strong>environment impact of a country</strong> alongside <strong>temperature increases</strong>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> 
    The filters are provided to see where <strong>Continents</strong> and different sized <strong>populations</strong> rank against eachother when comparing CO₂ emissions produced.

<script type="text/javascript">

  var spec2 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianpaolucci/assignment2/main/js/scatter_gdp_co2.vg.json";
  vegaEmbed('#scatter_plot', spec2).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script> 
     

  </div>
  <div class="right">
  <h3 class="right-text">How do these relate?</h3>
    From the visual, we can see a <strong>positive correlation</strong> between GDP per capita and CO₂ emissions produced. This may be a result of more <strong>trade activity</strong>. More productivity in a country means that there is more <strong>import/export transport</strong>and more  <strong>industrial work</strong> proceeding.
    <br>
    <br>
    Filtering by continent shows that <strong>South America</strong> is the Continent with the least CO₂ emissions per country. Interestingly, the forestation map above shows South America is very green, indicating there may be some correlation between more land forestation and less Carbon Dioxide Emissions. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Contrary to popular belief, countries in<strong> Asia </strong>do not produce the most Carbon Dioxide, but mainly countries within <strong>North America </strong>and <strong>Europe </strong>contribute the most.

<h2>Temperature Rise Over Time</h2>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="left">
  <h3 class="forestation">Global Warming</h3>
    We may have heard of the term <strong>'Global 'Warming'</strong>, but what does this phrase actually mean? It is a noun reserved to describe the slowly, but steadily <strong>increasing temperature across the world</strong>. This phenomena comes to fruition when analysing the <strong> rising water level</strong> as a result of the <strong>melting ice caps</strong>.
    <br>
    <h3 class="Emissions">Temperature Change</h3>
    The <strong>temperature change</strong> used in the visual is the net change in temperature <strong>by continent</strong> represented by <strong>decade</strong>.
  </div>
  <div class="middle">
  
      <div id="box_plot"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">

  var spec2 = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianpaolucci/assignment2/main/js/tempplot.vg.json";
  vegaEmbed('#box_plot', spec2).then(function(result) {
    // Access the Vega view instance (https://vega.github.io/vega/docs/api/view/) as result.view
  }).catch(console.error);
</script>
    
  
    
  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <h3>Why?</h3>
      It is clear that in general, the average temperature for each continent rises over time. This is due to the <strong>Ozone layer</strong> being destroyed over time. 
    <br>
    
    <h3 class="Emissions">Ozone Layer</h3>
    The <strong>Ozone Layer</strong> in laymans terms is essentially an invisible layer that products the Earth from the full force of the Sun. Temperature change can be classified by continent as temperature change will change depending on the <strong>Ozone layer degradation</strong> in that region.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Agricultural and Urban Land</h2>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="left">
   <h3 class="forestation">Agricultural Land</h3>
    <strong>Agricultural land</strong> is measured as a percentage of total land. We can deduce that a country which is partially <strong>self-sustainable</strong> will have more agricultural land. It could also mean that the country is <strong>less developed</strong>.
    <br>
    
    <h3 class="Emissions">Urban Land</h3>
    <strong>Urban land</strong> is measured as a percentage of total land as well. A country that is 'urban' can be assumed to be <strong>more developed</strong> and <strong>industrial</strong>. As a result, a more 'urban' country may be classified as this due to high production levels requiring more space to expand.

       <h3>The trend</h3>
      From the graph, an <strong>inversely proportional</strong> relationship between the two measures seems to be present. This may be a result of a country <strong>naturally or artificially</strong> focusing on the growth of one notion or the other.
    <br>
    
    <h3 class="Emissions">Relation to Emissions?</h3>
    Regardless of which type of land countries are more abundant of, CO₂ emissions seem to be mostly signifcant when a country is <strong>severely lacking</strong> in one or the other. Therefore, a balance is requried to ensure a country is not <strong>over-producing</strong> or <strong>over-importing</strong>, both which will increase artificial CO₂ emissions.
